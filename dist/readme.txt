[b]Starflight[/b]

[b]Overview:[/b]
Starflight is a dark theme, with a background animation mimicking interstellar flight.  Maybe helpful for Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5, etc., tv show or movie-oriented sites.  Maybe even NASA, astronomy or even astrology sites.  Or if you just want to zone out & pretend you're flying through space.  Whatever works.  

This theme is built up from the 2.1 Curve2 theme, with several features added for flexibility.

The goal is to provide a single very flexible, usable and feature-rich theme.  A theme that is usable right out of the box - no need to even build a custom banner, it dynamically builds one for you.

This theme is, in part, a demo.  Theme designers should feel free to borrow code & ideas.  It is very straightforward to copy these features over to any theme.
