# Starflight

## Overview:
Starflight is a dark theme, with a background animation mimicking interstellar flight.  Maybe helpful for Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5, etc., tv show or movie-oriented sites.  Maybe even NASA, astronomy or even astrology sites.  Or if you just want to zone out & pretend you're flying through space.  Whatever works.  

This theme is built up from the 2.1 Curve2 theme, with several features added for flexibility.

The goal is to provide a single very flexible, usable and feature-rich theme.  A theme that is usable right out of the box - no need to even build a custom banner, it dynamically builds one for you.

This theme is, in part, a demo.  Theme designers should feel free to borrow code & ideas.  It is very straightforward to copy these features over to any theme.

## Features:
* Background animations.  A simple framework is provided for animations.
* Simplified yet flexible color palette.  The forum's entire palette of colors may be updated on the Current Theme admin screen.
* Even the colors for checkboxes and radio buttons are under user control.  Including their backgrounds...  No more blinding white squares on dark themes...
* Real-time color updates.
* SVG graphics can use style elements from the theme.  E.g., the hamburger icon is dynamically colored to match your palette.
* Dynamically built SVG forum banners, guaranteed to match your forum color scheme.
* Color palette is automatically propagated down into the sceditor as well.

## Requirements:
* The Color Changer mod must be installed.  Or bad things happen.
* Javascript must be enabled for any of the js to work, including some admin functions as well as the animations.
* 2.1 only.

## Limitations:
* Some browsers handle the animations much better than others...  Modern browsers will be fine.  This was tested with Firefox, Pale Moon, Chrome, Edge and Safari (iPhone only).
